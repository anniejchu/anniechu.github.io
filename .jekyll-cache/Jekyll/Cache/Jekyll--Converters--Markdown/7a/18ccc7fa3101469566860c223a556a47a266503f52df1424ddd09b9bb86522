    <h4 class="lead">Hello!</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      I'm Annie (she/her), a 2nd year PhD student at Northwestern University in the <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology &amp; Social Behavior</a> program, a dual PhD
      program in Computer Science and Communications.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm currently at the <a href="https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/">Interactive Audio Lab</a>, advised by Dr. Bryan Pardo. My research interests lie at the intersection of audio, machine learning, multimodal systems, human-computer interaction, and accessible &amp; inclusive interfaces.
      <br />
      <br />
      Previously, I completed my B.S. in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering with a concentration in Media Arts at Olin College in Boston, MA. In my free time, you can find me walking around record shops, watching stand up, or playing bananagrams. I am also on the hunt for the best bagel in Chicago.
